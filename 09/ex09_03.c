 * 目的： Write a function that takes three arguments: a character and two integers.
 *       The character is to be printed. The first integer specifies the number of
 *       times that the character is to be printed on a line, and the second integer
 *       specifies the number of lines that are to be printed. Write a program
 *       that makes use of this function.
